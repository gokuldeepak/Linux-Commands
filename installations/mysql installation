ubuntu 18.04

sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server
sudo mysql_secure_installation
CREATE USER 'gokul'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'gokul'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;




If we can't login we have to change auth socket to mysql_native_password

SELECT user,authentication_string,plugin,host FROM mysql.user;


ALTER USER ‘root’@’localhost’ IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY ‘password’;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
now command mysql should not work from root. only mysql -u root -p should only work
